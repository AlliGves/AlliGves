      <div class="title"><h1>An Incomplete Version of The Incomplete Manifesto for Growth</h1></div>
      
      <div class="one">01 Allow events to change you. You have to be willing to grow. Growth is different from something that happens to you. You produce it. You live it. The prerequisites for growth: the openness to experience events and the willingness to be changed by them.</div>
      
      <div class="three">03 Process is more important than outcome. When the outcome drives the process we will only ever go to where we’ve already been. If process drives outcome we may not know where we’re going, but we will know we want to be there.</div>
      
      <div class="nine">09 Begin anywhere. John Cage tells us that not knowing where to begin is a common form of paralysis. His advice: begin anywhere.</div>
      
      <div class="fourteen">14 Don’t be cool. Cool is conservative fear dressed in black. Free yourself from limits of this sort.</div>
      
      <div class="seventeen">17 ____________________. Intentionally left blank. Allow space for the ideas you haven’t had yet, and for the ideas of others.</div>
     
      <div class="twentyfive">25 Don’t clean your desk. You might find something in the morning that you can’t see tonight.</div>
      
      <div class="thirtytwo">32 Listen carefully. Every collaborator who enters our orbit brings with him or her a world more strange and complex than any we could ever hope to imagine. By listening to the details and the subtlety of their needs, desires, or ambitions, we fold their world onto our own. Neither party will ever be the same.</div>
